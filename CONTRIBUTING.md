# How to contribute

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

To get an overview of the project, please read the [README](README.md).

## Getting started

Please check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem or want to suggest an enhancement, [search if it already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).
If a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue here on GitHub.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you.
You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.
As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone.
If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
   - Using GitHub Desktop:
     - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
     - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)!
   - Using the command line:
     - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

Always write a clear log message for your commits.
One-line messages are fine for small changes.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal.
We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments.
You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI.
You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations and Thanks for your contribution.
